        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://conduit.wagener.org">This demo</a> means to help clarify how
            <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a>-based applications perform
            when loading large amounts of data into a <code>Backbone.Collection</code>.  Backbone is great at many
            things, but data sets larger than several thousand items can result in poor application performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The demo runs through the same cycle using three different techniques: One uses basic Backbone techniques, while
            the other two leverage the <a href="http://pwagener.github.io/backbone.conduit/">Backbone.Conduit</a>
            plugin, which provides different <code>Backbone.Collection</code> implementations that are optimized for
            larger data.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>What The Demo Does</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this demo is to explore how long it takes to prepare large data sets for use by an application.
            This demo shows loading data into a Backbone collection broken down into four steps typically taken
            by an application:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fetch & Parse the Raw Data</li>
            <li>Create the <code>Backbone.Model</code> instances</li>
            <li>Filter the data in a non-trivial way (here, only the most recent entry for each restaurant)</li>
            <li>Sort the Data in a non-trivial way (here by date, then by name)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After that, the application shows the first three entries in the collection in a simple bit of HTML.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>About The Data</h2>
        <p>
            The data set used here is all the NYC Restaurant Health Grades over the past several years (~ 221K entries); the smaller
            data sets are just truncated versions.  The demo loads static JSON files from the server, where each entry
            looks like:
    <pre>
        [
            {"name":"Morris Park Bake Sho","zip":10462,"grade":"A","date":"02/09/2015"},
            {"name":"Wendy's","zip":11225,"grade":"A","date":"12/30/2014"},
            {"name":"Dj Reynolds Pub And","zip":10019,"grade":"A","date":"09/06/2014"},
            ...
        ]</pre>

        <p>
            Like most real-world data, this stuff is far from perfect.  Many restaurants have duplicate entries; some
            don't have dates on them at all.  This forces us to write sorting & filtering methods that handle these
            typical real-world data inconsistencies.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Three Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            The three implementations differ in two ways:  how much work they do, and whether each step in the process is
            <span class="label label-warning">Synchronous</span> or <span class="label label-success">Asynchronous</span>.
            The less work the step takes, the shorter amount of time is required.  And since the UI in browsers is
            single-threaded, asynchronous steps provide a much better user experience: the UI doesn't "hang" while doing
            other work.
        </p>

        <h4>Example #1: Benchmarking Backbone.Collection</h4>
        <p>
            The first example uses a basic <code>Backbone.Collection</code>.
            <strong>Create Models</strong>, <strong>Filter Collection</strong> and <strong>Sort Collection</strong> steps are
            <span class="label label-warning">synchronous</span>. Some interesting things to note on this implementation:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The smallest size, 5K items, performs moderately well on fast hardware</li>
                <li>Larger sizes start to hang the browser pretty significantly because of the synchronous steps</li>
                <li>At 100K or larger, the "Create Models" step dominates the time taken</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Example #2: Optimized Model Creation via Conduit.QuickCollection</h4>
        <p>
            As Example #1 shows, the <strong>Model Creation</strong> step is very expensive.  Example #2 shows
            performance differences when we treat this as a first class problem.  The  <code>Collection</code> used here
            mixes in the same behavior available in <code>Conduit.QuickCollection</code> functionality, which
            is optimized to create models ~ 45% faster than the benchmark.  As a result:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Performance of the "Create Models" step is consistently better</li>
            <li>The "Filter Collection" and "Sort Collection" stages are virtually identical to #1</li>
            <li>The UI still hangs significantly with larger data sizes due to the
                <span class="label label-warning">synchronous</span> nature of the final steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example #3:  Web Worker Data Management via Conduit.SparseCollection</h4>
        <p>
            As Example #2 shows, even optimizing the least-scalable step (Model Creation) has it limits.  To really scale,
            we need to make a fundamental change.  Example #3 demonstrates this change, adding behavior available in a
            <code>Conduit.SparseCollection</code>.  This shifts  as much of the work as possible to
            another thread via a Web Worker, including the raw data storage (thus the "Sparse" part of the name).  It
            also does not create any <code>Backbone.Model</code> instances unless they are explicitly needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows all of the steps to be <span class="label label-success">asynchronous</span>, allowing the UI
            thread to work smoothly even at large data sizes.  More specifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The raw data fetched and stored on the web worker</li>
            <li>Sorting and Filtering are much faster at large data sized, because we deal with the raw data instead of
            <code>Backbone.Model</code>s</li>
            <li>The "Create Models" step is the very last one, and does vastly less work:  it creates <code>Backbone.Model</code>
                instances only when completely necessary; in this case <mark>only three models are created</mark>,
                because that is all we need</li>
            <li>The technique shown is only limited by how much memory you have available on your client, and how
                quickly you can get the raw data to the client</li>
        </ul>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Where Do We Go From Here</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>Backbone.Conduit</code> plugin <a href="http://pwagener.github.io/backbone.conduit/">is in active development</a>.  The
            <a href="http://pwagener.github.io/backbone.conduit/QuickCollection/">Conduit.QuickCollection</a> is a drop-in replacement
            for a <code>Backbone.Collection</code> for most use cases.  It should be useful anywhere you believe you
            may have more than a few hundred models.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>Conduit.SparseCollection</code> is still somewhat experimental, but is very
            promising.  The data access pattern is fundamentally different, but all functionality is exposed via Promises
            using methods that are functional equivalents to a regular <code>Backbone.Collection</code>.  It is not a
            drop-in replacement, but should definitely be considered when
        </p>
        <p>

# Examples

Please check out the [live demo](http://conduit.wagener.org).

If you are interested in the code behind the demo, it is 
[included in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/pwagener/backbone.conduit/tree/master/examples), with details on
running the example locally.

The data-handling pieces of the demo are mostly limited to:

* BasicCollection.js - A basic `Backbone.Collection` instance that is used as a benchmark
* ConduitCollection.js - An example of extending `Conduit.QuickCollection` for faster data handling
* SparseCollection.js - An example of extending `Conduit.SparseCollection` for scalable, asynchronous data handling

Please the the [About page](http://conduit.wagener.org/about.html) of the demo for details of what the code is doing.
